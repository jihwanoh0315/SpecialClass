CLASS 6
    COORDINATE SYSTEM

WHAT TO DO IN THIS CHAPTER
**
    Move the object using coordinate system
    
    Local space ->(model matrix)-> World space
    ->(view matrix)-> View space ->(projection matrix)-> Clip space
    
    >> Clip = Projection x View x Model x Local
**

1. Set model matrix (to World space)

2. Set view matrix (Camera)
    - Don't have camera now, so set with arbitrary value
    
3. Set projection matrix (Screen)
    - Set with screen size
    
4. Send it to the shader
    - Use uniform
    
5. Calculate the coordinate of object with sent data in shader
    -> Clip = Projection x View x Model x Local
