CLASS 7
	CAMERA

WHAT TO DO IN THIS CHAPTER
**
	To set the view matrix for each object,
	we need to create the camera with class
**

1. Set the setting values
- Field of view, movement speed ...

2. Set the position and target of camera

3. Get direction with position and target
- Use simple vector calculation

4. Get right and up direction of camera with world up dir (0,1,0)
- Use cross product between your vector

5. Set the view matrix with look at function
- Use transpose matrix to get easy with inverse matrix
- You can simply do this with glm::lookat function

6. Set the projection matrix with screen and FoV angle
