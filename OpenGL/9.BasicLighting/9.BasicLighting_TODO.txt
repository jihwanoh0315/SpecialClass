CLASS 9
	BASIC LIGHTING

WHAT TO DO IN THIS CHAPTER
**
	Do the Phong Shading
	Three lighting values are set the color of vertex
	and we add them to set color
	*NEED TO get normals from each triangles on object
**
1. Ambient
	- Color shown by some far-far light source like moon

2. Diffuse
	- Use dot product for each vertex between light and normal vector
	** don't forget to normalize the vertex normal
	
3. Specular
	- Get reflect vector with normal and light
	- dot to the eye-to-vertex vector
	- Should be different depending on model, but not now

***
	HOW TO GET VERTEX NORMAL
***
1. Get the three vertices from vertex vector with index vector
2. Use the cross product with those values
3. If it contain many normals, add them and normalize it
